The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the Fujitsu 'MB9BF506' 
microcontroller using Keil 'MCB9BF500' Evaluation Board, compliant 
to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v1.30).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL  =   4 MHz
   - PLL0  =  80 MHz
   - CCLK  =  80 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 8 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 10 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto ITM debug port #0  



The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  MB9BF50x RAM:    runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                   (used for target debugging)

  MB9BF50x Flash:  runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                   (used for production or target debugging)
